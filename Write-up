Explaination:
1. There are 3 files main.c,E1.c,E2.c
2. In main.c we will fork child process S1 and it registers sigterm using signal()
3. Waitpid is used to stop the parent process untill child process ends after which parent process will be resumed
4. Now parent process resumes and forks chiled processess SR and ST
5. SR regsiters a sigalrm() using signal() with alarm time=2 seconds and ST also registers sigalrm() using signal()
6. Both SR and ST calls on E1 and E2 executable files using execvp() respectively.
7. E1 prints random number whereas E2 prints time used by CPU.
